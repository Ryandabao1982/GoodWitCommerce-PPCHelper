## Technical Implementation

### Type System Updates

```typescript
// New match type for keywords
export type MatchType = 'Broad' | 'Phrase' | 'Exact';

// Bid modifier structure
export interface BidModifiers {
  topOfSearch?: number;
  productPages?: number;
}

// Enhanced AdGroup with new fields
export interface AdGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  keywords: string[];
  defaultBid?: number;
  defaultMatchType?: MatchType;
  bidModifiers?: BidModifiers;
  budget?: number;
}

// Campaign with daily budget
export interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  adGroups: AdGroup[];
  dailyBudget?: number;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Template System

Templates are defined in `utils/campaignTemplates.ts` with:
- Name and description
- Campaign category
- Suggested daily budget
- Ad group configurations with percentages, match types, and default bids

The `createCampaignFromTemplate()` function:
1. Generates unique IDs
2. Calculates ad group budgets from percentages
3. Applies default settings
4. Returns fully configured Campaign object

## Best Practices

### Budget Allocation
- Start with template-suggested budgets
- Monitor performance for 7-14 days
- Redistribute based on ROAS/ACoS
- Pause low-performing ad groups rather than deleting

### Bid Strategy
- Use template default bids as starting points
- Increase bids on high-converting keywords
- Decrease bids on high-spend, low-convert keywords
- Review bid modifiers weekly

### Match Type Strategy
- **Broad**: Discovery and research phase
- **Phrase**: Controlled targeting, proven keywords
- **Exact**: Best performers, maximum control

### Bid Modifiers
- **Top of Search**: +50-100% for branded terms, +25-50% for generic
- **Product Pages**: 0-25% for complementary products, -50% to reduce spend

## Testing Coverage

- ‚úÖ 19 tests for campaign template validation
- ‚úÖ Template structure verification
- ‚úÖ Budget distribution calculations
- ‚úÖ Match type and bid assignment
- ‚úÖ Unique ID generation

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions based on this foundation:

- Bid rules and automation
- Performance forecasting based on settings
- A/B testing framework
- Campaign cloning and templates saving
- Historical bid performance tracking

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing campaigns without new fields continue to work
- Optional fields default to sensible values:
  - `defaultBid`: undefined (user sets manually)
  - `defaultMatchType`: 'Broad'
  - `bidModifiers`: { topOfSearch: 50, productPages: 0 }
  - `dailyBudget`: undefined

### Data Structure
All new fields are optional, ensuring existing localStorage data remains valid.
