### Key Components

- **App.tsx** - Main container, routing, and state management
- **BrandCreationModal.tsx** - Brand workspace creation interface
- **Types.ts** - TypeScript interfaces for Brand, Keyword, Campaign structures

### Data Persistence

The application supports two storage modes with seamless switching:

**1. Local Storage (Default - No Sign In)**

- Data stored in browser `localStorage`
- No authentication required
- Works offline
- Data isolated to single browser
- Fast and private

**2. Cloud Database (Sign In with Supabase)**

- Persistent cloud storage with PostgreSQL
- Multi-device synchronization
- User authentication and authorization
- Automatic backups and recovery
- Secure with row-level security (RLS)
- See [Supabase Migration Guide](docs/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details

**Hybrid Storage Pattern:**

- When signed in: Database-first with localStorage cache
- When not signed in: localStorage only
- Automatic fallback if connection lost
- No data loss when switching modes

Both modes store:

- Brand configurations
- Keyword banks and search history
- Campaign structures and ad groups
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Keyword clusters and analytics

**Getting Started with Cloud Sync:**

1. Click "Sign In" button in the header
2. Create a free account or sign in
3. Your data automatically syncs to the cloud
4. Access from any device with your account

For existing users: Your localStorage data is preserved! See the [Supabase Migration Guide](docs/SUPABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details on migrating to cloud storage.

- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **API Integration**: Abstracted service layer for Gemini API

### Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite with 524 tests covering utilities, services, components, and complete user path simulations. See [TEST_README.md](./TEST_README.md) for detailed test documentation.

**Test Coverage:**

- Utilities: 93.54% (storage, sorting)
- Services: 91.54% (geminiService)
- Components: 100% (LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, WelcomeMessage, QuickStartGuide, ApiKeyPrompt)
- **User Path Simulations**: 10 comprehensive end-to-end tests tracing complete user journeys

**Quick Start:**

```bash
npm test              # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run      # Run tests once
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report

# Run user path simulation tests
npm run test:run __tests__/e2e/userPath.simulation.test.tsx
./scripts/run-user-path-tests.sh  # Dedicated script with detailed output
```

**User Path Testing:**

User path tests simulate complete user journeys from root, including:

- First-time user onboarding flow
- Keyword research workflow
- View navigation and state persistence
- Multi-brand workflow and data isolation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Function tracing during user interactions

See [USER_PATH_TESTING.md](./docs/USER_PATH_TESTING.md) for detailed documentation.

### Developer Experience (DX) Tools

This project uses modern development tools to ensure code quality and consistency:

**Linting & Formatting:**

```bash
npm run lint          # Check for code issues
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format        # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check  # Check formatting without changes
```

**Git Hooks:**

- Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting and formatting on staged files
- Powered by Husky and lint-staged for fast, focused checks

**Release Management:**

```bash
npm run release        # Create a new release (auto-detects version bump)
npm run release:patch  # Bump patch version (0.0.x)
npm run release:minor  # Bump minor version (0.x.0)
npm run release:major  # Bump major version (x.0.0)
```

Releases use [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) with conventional commits to automatically generate changelogs.
