**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: Enhanced Campaign Templates with Detailed Taxonomy
**Tags**: [feature, ui, ux, campaign-management, templates]

**Summary**:
- Overhauled the campaign creation process by replacing the previous generic templates with 15 specific, expert-level campaign structures.
- The new templates are derived directly from the "Amazon PPC Campaign Type Taxonomy Reference," ensuring they align with industry best practices for Sponsored Products, Sponsored Brands, and Sponsored Display campaigns.
- Each template in `CampaignManager.tsx` now includes a detailed description of its strategic purpose and automatically generates a relevant set of pre-configured ad groups with dynamic naming based on the campaign prefix.

---
### **Notable Fixes & Technical Decisions**

-   **Issue**: The previous campaign creation method (a simple name input) was too generic and did not fully capture the strategic nuance required for professional Amazon PPC management. This placed a higher cognitive load on the user to know how to structure their campaigns correctly.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**: The initial implementation prioritized flexibility but lacked the prescriptive guidance that accelerates expert-level workflows. To make the tool more powerful and opinionated, it needed to embed best practices directly into its features.
-   **Resolution (The Enhancement)**:
    1.  **Taxonomy Integration**: An industry-standard taxonomy was analyzed and codified into a new `campaignTemplates` array in `CampaignManager.tsx`. This array now contains 15+ distinct templates, each corresponding to a specific strategy (e.g., `sp_auto_research`, `sb_video_awareness`, `sd_remarketing_buyers`).
    2.  **Strategic Ad Groups**: Each template object includes a `generateAdGroups` function that creates a logical set of starting ad groups. For example, the "SP - Branded Defense" template automatically creates "Brand Exact" and "Brand Phrase" ad groups, saving the user manual setup time.
    3.  **Improved User Guidance**: Each template now has a descriptive `label` and `description` that is displayed in the UI. This educates the user on the purpose of each campaign type, helping them make more informed strategic decisions directly within the tool. This transforms the campaign manager from a simple creation tool into a strategic planning assistant.

-   **Issue**: The previous campaign templates ("Standard," "Brand Focus," etc.) were too generic and did not fully capture the strategic nuance required for professional Amazon PPC management. This placed a higher cognitive load on the user to know how to structure their campaigns correctly.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**: The initial implementation prioritized flexibility but lacked the prescriptive guidance that accelerates expert-level workflows. To make the tool more powerful and opinionated, it needed to embed best practices directly into its features.

### **Date: 2024-05-23 14:00:00 UTC**
**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: UI Structural Refactor for Unified Workflow
**Tags**: [refactor, ui, ux, architecture, components]

**Summary**:
- Executed a major UI refactor to unify the campaign management workflow, addressing a core architectural issue.
- Consolidated campaign creation and planning into a single "Campaign Planner" view, creating a dedicated workspace for all campaign-related activities.
- Created a new `CampaignPlannerView.tsx` component by renaming and enhancing the old `CampaignsView.tsx`.
- Streamlined `KeywordBank.tsx` by removing campaign management responsibilities, clarifying its role as a pure keyword library.
- Updated `App.tsx` to render the new two-column planner layout and adjusted `ViewSwitcher.tsx` with clearer navigation labels to reflect the improved application structure.

---
### **Notable Fixes & Technical Decisions**

-   **Issue**: The application's UI structure was fragmented, leading to an unintuitive user experience. Campaign creation (`CampaignManager`) and campaign analysis/projections (`CampaignsView`) were located in different, disconnected parts of the application. The `KeywordBank` view was also overloaded with campaign management duties, blurring its primary function.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**: The initial design did not fully integrate the natural user workflow of researching keywords, organizing them, and then building campaigns from that research. This led to a separation of components that were logically coupled, forcing users to switch between different views to perform a single, cohesive task.
-   **Resolution (The Refactor)**:
    1.  **Unified Workspace**: A new "Campaign Planner" view was established as the central hub for all campaign activities. In `App.tsx`, this view now renders the `CampaignManager` and `CampaignPlannerView` components in a side-by-side, two-column layout. This allows users to build their campaign structure and analyze projections within a single, cohesive screen.
    2.  **Component Migration**: The existing `CampaignsView.tsx` was renamed to `CampaignPlannerView.tsx` and now serves as the main content area of the planner, responsible for displaying the rich, expandable campaign cards and projection data. The old `CampaignsView.tsx` was deleted.
    3.  **Separation of Concerns**: `KeywordBank.tsx` was refactored to remove the `CampaignManager`. This simplifies the component and clarifies its sole purpose: managing the brand's library of keywords. The user workflow is now clearer: find keywords in the "Bank" and then build campaigns with them in the "Planner".
    4.  **Clearer Navigation**: The labels in `ViewSwitcher.tsx` were updated to "Dashboard", "Keyword Bank", and "Campaign Planner" to more accurately reflect the distinct functions of each primary view and guide the user logically through the application.

### **Date: 2024-05-23 13:00:00 UTC**
**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: Major Architectural Refactor for Stability
**Tags**: [refactor, architecture, typescript, stability, api, utils]

**Summary**:
- Executed a major refactor to address the root causes of persistent type errors and critical API failures.
- Introduced two new utility modules, `utils/storage.ts` and `utils/helpers.ts`, to centralize and safely handle data operations.
- Corrected a structural mismatch in the `fetchCampaignProjections` API call, resolving a recurring `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.
- Refactored components (`App.tsx`, `KeywordBank.tsx`) to use the new utility functions, improving code clarity and robustness.
- Removed the unused `components/CampaignPlanner.tsx` file to clean up the project.

---
### **Notable Fixes & Technical Decisions**

-   **Issue**: The application suffered from two recurring, critical problems: 1) Persistent TypeScript errors on data loaded from `localStorage` or after being deep-cloned. 2) A reliable `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` error from the Gemini API when generating campaign projections.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**:
    1.  **Type Safety**: Using `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` for deep cloning and `JSON.parse()` for `localStorage` hydration was causing TypeScript to lose type information for nested data, defaulting to `unknown` and leading to runtime errors.
    2.  **API Schema**: The `fetchCampaignProjections` function was requesting a schema where a property (`suggestedAdGroupBudgets`) was defined as `Type.OBJECT`. The API's validator requires that objects have their properties explicitly defined, which is incompatible with the app's need for a dynamic dictionary (`{ [adGroupId]: budget }`).
-   **Resolution (The Refactor)**:
    1.  **Centralized Storage Logic**: Created `utils/storage.ts` with generic `saveToLocalStorage` and `loadFromLocalStorage` functions. These utilities encapsulate the unsafe `JSON` operations, include error handling, and provide a single, type-safe interface for all `localStorage` interactions.
    2.  **Safe Cloning Utility**: Created `utils/helpers.ts` with a `safeDeepClone` generic function. This provides a clear, type-safe wrapper around the `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` method, making the intent clear and preventing type-related errors in components.
    3.  **API Call Correction**: The `fetchCampaignProjections` function in `services/geminiService.ts` was fixed by changing the prompt and `responseSchema` to request an `ARRAY` of objects (e.g., `[{ adGroupId: "id", budget: 100 }]`), which is a structure the API can validate. The service layer then transforms this array back into the dictionary format the application's state requires, isolating the fix and ensuring no UI components needed to be changed.

### **Date: 2024-05-23 11:00:00 UTC**
**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: Documentation Update & Gemini API Fix
**Tags**: [documentation, bugfix, api, gemini, schema]

**Summary**:
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` to version `1.0.2` to reflect the fix for the Gemini API schema validation error.
- Added a detailed technical breakdown of the API issue and resolution below.

---
### **Notable Fixes & Technical Decisions**

-   **Issue**: Gemini API `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` on `fetchCampaignProjections` function.
-   **Symptoms**: The API returned an error: `GenerateContentRequest.generation_config.response_schema.properties[\"suggestedAdGroupBudgets\"].properties: should be non-empty for OBJECT type`.
-   **Root Cause**: The `responseSchema` for the request defined `suggestedAdGroupBudgets` as `Type.OBJECT`. The Gemini API's schema validation requires that any property of type `OBJECT` must have its own `properties` defined. The application was expecting a dictionary with dynamic keys (e.g., `{ adGroupId: budget }`), which cannot be described this way in the schema.
-   **Resolution**: The fix was implemented entirely within the `services/geminiService.ts` file to avoid downstream changes:
    1.  The prompt was updated to instruct the model to return an array of objects, e.g., `[{ adGroupId: 'id', budget: 100 }]`.
    2.  The `responseSchema` for `suggestedAdGroupBudgets` was changed from `Type.OBJECT` to `Type.ARRAY`, with `items` defined as an object with explicit `adGroupId` (string) and `budget` (number) properties. This satisfies the API's validation rules.
    3.  After receiving a valid response, the service layer transforms the array of budget objects back into the `Record<string, number>` (dictionary) format that the rest of the application's state management expects. This isolates the change and maintains the existing internal data contract.

**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: Documentation Update & Bug Fixes
**Tags**: [documentation, bugfix, typescript]

**Summary**:
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with a new version `1.0.1` to document recent UI improvements and critical bug fixes.
- Added a new section below to formally document a recurring technical issue and its resolution, as requested.

---
### **Notable Fixes & Technical Decisions**

-   **Issue**: TypeScript Type Inference Errors after `JSON.parse`.
-   **Symptoms**: Multiple components (`KeywordBank.tsx`, `App.tsx`) were throwing runtime errors when attempting to call methods like `.toLowerCase()` or `.has()` on array elements.
-   **Root Cause**: The application frequently uses `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for deep cloning state objects or parsing data from `localStorage`. In TypeScript, this operation is type-unsafe for nested structures. The compiler correctly infers the resulting nested array elements as `unknown` because the type information is lost during serialization and deserialization.
-   **Resolution**: Applied explicit type assertions (e.g., `(kw as string).toLowerCase()`) immediately after the `JSON.parse` operation. This informs the TypeScript compiler of the expected type, restoring type safety and allowing property access without errors. This fix was applied to keyword processing in `KeywordBank.tsx` and state hydration in `App.tsx`.

### **Date: 2024-05-22 14:30:00 UTC**
**Author**: AI Vibe Coder
**Action**: Refactor and Reposition Welcome Component
**Tags**: [refactor, ui, ux]

**Summary**:
- In response to user feedback, the welcome/empty state message was restored and refactored into a dedicated `WelcomeMessage` component.
- The component has been repositioned to appear prominently above the seed keyword input section, providing a clearer initial user experience and call-to-action.
- As part of this refactor, the `Dashboard` component was simplified to be a pure data-display component, only rendering when keyword data is available. This improves component separation and clarifies application flow.
- This change addresses user requests to restore the welcome section to its original, more logical position.
