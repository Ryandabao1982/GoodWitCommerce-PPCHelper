- Grouped by feature

✅ **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**
- Setup clearly separated
- Actions explicit
- Assertions meaningful

✅ **Mock External Dependencies**
- Gemini API mocked
- Supabase client mocked
- LocalStorage mocked in setup

✅ **User-Centric Testing**
- Testing Library queries
- User event simulation
- Accessibility-focused

### 8.2 Additional Practices to Adopt

⏳ **Test Data Builders**
- Create factories for test data
- Reduce boilerplate
- Improve maintainability

⏳ **Custom Testing Utilities**
- Wrapper for common setup
- Custom matchers
- Helper functions

⏳ **Coverage Thresholds**
- Enforce minimum coverage
- Block PRs below threshold
- Track coverage trends

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm install
      - run: node scripts/simulate-workflow.js
```

### 9.2 Quality Gates

1. **Tests must pass** - All 130+ tests
2. **Coverage threshold** - Maintain 80%+
3. **Build must succeed** - No compilation errors
4. **Simulation must pass** - All scenarios green
5. **No console errors** - (Except intentional test errors)
