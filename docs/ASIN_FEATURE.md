# ASIN-Based Keyword Research & Campaign Planning

## Overview

This feature adds the ability to perform keyword research and campaign planning specific to individual Amazon products (ASINs). This enables more targeted and product-specific keyword strategies.

## What's New

### 1. ASIN Input Field

A new ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) input field has been added to the Advanced Options section of the keyword research interface.

**Location**: Keyword Research ‚Üí Advanced Options ‚Üí ASIN field

**Features**:
- Optional field for entering product ASINs (e.g., B08N5WRWNW)
- Validation for proper ASIN format
- Stored per-brand in advanced search settings
- Persists across sessions

### 2. ASIN-Specific Keyword Research

When an ASIN is provided, the AI keyword research will:
- Focus on keywords specifically relevant to that product
- Adjust relevance scores based on product-keyword fit
- Generate more targeted keyword suggestions
- Consider product-specific attributes and use cases

**How it works**:
1. Enter your seed keyword (e.g., "wireless headphones")
2. Click "Advanced Options"
3. Enter the ASIN of your product (e.g., B08N5WRWNW)
4. Click "Search"
5. AI generates keywords optimized for that specific product

### 3. Campaign Planning per ASIN

Campaigns and ad groups now support ASIN association:

**Campaign Level**:
- Each campaign can be associated with a specific ASIN
- Track which campaigns are running for which products
- Better organization for multi-product brands

**Ad Group Level**:
- Ad groups within campaigns can target specific ASINs
- Enables product-specific targeting strategies
- Better segmentation for A/B testing

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Product Research

```
Brand: TechGadgets Pro
Product: Wireless Bluetooth Headphones
ASIN: B08N5WRWNW

Steps:
1. Select "TechGadgets Pro" brand
2. Enter seed keyword: "bluetooth headphones"
3. Open Advanced Options
4. Enter ASIN: B08N5WRWNW
5. Click Search

Result: Keywords specifically tailored for that headphone model
```

### Example 2: Multi-Product Brand

```
Brand: EcoHome
Products: 
- Product A (ASIN: B08ABC123) - Bamboo Cutting Board
- Product B (ASIN: B08XYZ789) - Reusable Food Wraps

Workflow:
1. Research keywords for Product A with its ASIN
2. Create Campaign "Bamboo Board Campaign" with ASIN B08ABC123
3. Research keywords for Product B with its ASIN
4. Create Campaign "Food Wraps Campaign" with ASIN B08XYZ789

Result: Separate, product-specific campaigns with targeted keywords
```

### Example 3: Product Line Expansion

```
Scenario: Launching a new product variant

1. Research existing product ASIN (B08OLD123)
2. Analyze which keywords work well
3. Enter new product ASIN (B08NEW456)
4. Research with same seed keywords
5. Compare keyword suggestions
6. Identify unique opportunities for new product

Result: Optimized keyword strategy for product launch
```

## Technical Implementation

### Type Definitions

```typescript
// AdvancedSearchSettings now includes ASIN
export interface AdvancedSearchSettings {
  advancedKeywords: string;
  minVolume: string;
  maxVolume: string;
  isWebAnalysisEnabled: boolean;
  brandName: string;
  asin?: string; // New field
}

// Campaign now includes ASIN
export interface Campaign {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  adGroups: AdGroup[];
  dailyBudget?: number;
  asin?: string; // New field
}

// AdGroup now includes ASIN
export interface AdGroup {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  keywords: string[];
  defaultBid?: number;
  defaultMatchType?: MatchType;
  asin?: string; // New field
}
```

### AI Integration

The Gemini AI service now receives ASIN context:

```typescript
export async function fetchKeywords(
  seedKeyword: string,
  isWebAnalysisEnabled: boolean,
  brandName: string = '',
  asin: string = '' // New parameter
): Promise<[KeywordData[], string[]]>
```

When an ASIN is provided, the AI prompt includes:
- Product-specific context
- Enhanced relevance scoring
- Focus on product-appropriate keywords
- Consideration of product attributes

### Data Persistence

ASIN data is stored:
- **Per-Brand**: Each brand's search settings include ASIN
- **Per-Campaign**: Campaign structures include ASIN associations
- **Per-Ad Group**: Individual ad groups can target specific ASINs
- **LocalStorage**: All ASIN data persists across sessions
- **Supabase**: ASIN data syncs with cloud storage (if enabled)

## UI/UX Improvements

### Input Field
- Clear placeholder text: "e.g., B08N5WRWNW (optional)"
- Helpful description: "Research keywords specifically for this product"
- Disabled when no brand is active
- Part of Advanced Options (not cluttering main interface)

### Visual Indicators
