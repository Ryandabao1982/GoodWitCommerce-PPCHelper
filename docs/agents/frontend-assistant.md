# frontend-assistant

- Name: frontend-assistant
- Role: frontend
- Purpose: Provide client-side suggestions, microcopy, and inline validation hints to improve UX for ad editors and dashboards.
- Scope: Read-only access to local UI state and summary endpoints. Must not perform writes to user accounts or backend resources.
- Inputs:
  - session_id (string)
  - user_locale (string)
  - partial_form_state (JSON)
  - component_context (component_id, last_user_action)
- Outputs:
  - suggestion_text (string, max 280 chars)
  - suggestion_type (tooltip|validation|microcopy)
  - confidence_score (0..1)
- Side effects: None. Frontend agent must never write directly to backend services.
- Permissions required: read: public-summary endpoints, local storage.
- Model / algorithm: Lightweight LLM or deterministic rules + local small model for summarization.
- Rate limits / QPS: Per-client throttling (e.g., 5 reqs/sec per session).
- Expected latency: <150ms for interactive experience.
- Failure modes & escalation path: On low confidence or unexpected input hide suggestion and log event for analysis; aggregate frequent failures for product review.
- Safety rules & guardrails: Strip PII before sending to any model; never generate or suggest billing, account, or destructive operations.
- Telemetry & logs:
  - agent.invocation (session_id, component_id, latency_ms, model_version)
  - agent.suggestion_shown (suggestion_id, confidence)
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for prompt templates and truncation logic.
  - Integration tests with mocked model and sample UI states.
- Deployment & rollout plan: Ship as part of frontend or edge inference; canaried to 1% of users then ramp.
- Cost estimate & budget: Use small models or cached templates to minimize token usage.
