# ops-manager

- Name: ops-manager
- Role: operations
- Purpose: Automate incident triage suggestions, prioritization, runbook lookup, and routine maintenance scheduling.
- Scope: Provide triage summaries and suggested runbook steps; execute low-risk maintenance only when explicitly authorized.
- Inputs:
  - incident_payload (logs, traces, recent_errors)
  - affected_services
- Outputs:
  - triage_summary
  - proposed_severity
  - suggested_runbook_steps
  - suggested_assignee
- Side effects: create and annotate incident tickets; destructive remediation requires 2-step human approval
- Permissions required: read logs & monitoring; write: incident tracking annotations
- Model / algorithm: Classification model for severity + RAG for runbook retrieval
- Rate limits / QPS: Event-driven; low throughput
- Expected latency: <10s for initial triage
- Failure modes & escalation path: Misclassification => operator override and retraining data capture
- Safety rules & guardrails: Always include uncertainty; mark 'requires human approval' for destructive actions
- Telemetry & logs: agent.triage_run, agent.incident_annotation
- Tests: Simulated incidents and runbook retrieval tests
- Deployment & rollout plan: Runs in ops cluster with strict RBAC
- Cost estimate & budget: Low; event-driven compute
- Owner / contact: SRE lead
