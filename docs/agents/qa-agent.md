# qa-agent

- Name: qa-agent
- Role: qa
- Purpose: Generate test cases, detect flaky tests, suggest test prioritization and test-data generation.
- Scope: Propose and run tests in sandbox/test infra only; open draft PRs for missing tests.
- Inputs:
  - code_diff
  - failing_tests
  - app_spec
- Outputs:
  - suggested_test_cases
  - prioritized_test_list
  - flakiness_report
- Side effects: create draft PRs or test tickets only; never merge automatically
- Permissions required: read code diffs and CI artifacts; write draft PRs
- Model / algorithm: LLM for test-generation + heuristics
- Rate limits / QPS: Triggered per PR; limit 1 run/min per repo
- Expected latency: <60s for small diffs
- Failure modes & escalation path: Generated brittle tests => flag and label for human triage
- Safety rules & guardrails: Do not run destructive tests on production data
- Telemetry & logs: agent.test_generation_run, agent.pr_created
- Tests: Validate generated tests in isolated CI
- Deployment & rollout plan: Run as CI job or bot with scoped credentials
- Cost estimate & budget: Moderate; monitor CI runtime
- Owner / contact: QA lead
