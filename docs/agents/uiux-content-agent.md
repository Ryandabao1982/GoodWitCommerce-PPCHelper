# uiux-content-agent

- Name: uiux-content-agent
- Role: ui/ux
- Purpose: Generate accessible copy, microcopy variations, alt text, and surface accessibility issues for review.
- Scope: Suggest copy and accessibility fixes; cannot change live content without explicit approval from a human reviewer.
- Inputs:
  - component_id
  - current_text
  - accessibility_report (axe/pa11y JSON)
  - locale
- Outputs:
  - recommended_text_options (list)
  - accessibility_issues_fixed (list)
  - confidence_score
- Side effects: create draft copy entries or PRs for review; no direct publish without approval.
- Permissions required: read/write drafts, open PRs (review required to merge)
- Model / algorithm: LLM tuned for concise UX copy + accessibility rules engine
- Rate limits / QPS: Triggered on content change events; low throughput.
- Expected latency: <2s for suggestions
- Failure modes & escalation path: Sensitive or legal wording detected => escalate to product/legal reviewer.
- Safety rules & guardrails: Do not generate pricing/claim statements; follow style guide constraints.
- Telemetry & logs: agent.copy_suggestion, agent.accessibility_alert
- Tests: Style guide compliance tests, accessibility regression tests
- Deployment & rollout plan: GitOps workflow that opens PRs/drafts for human review
- Cost estimate & budget: Low-volume; monitor token usage for batch runs
