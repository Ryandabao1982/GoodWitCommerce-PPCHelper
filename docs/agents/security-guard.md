# security-guard

- Name: security-guard
- Role: security
- Purpose: Scan code, dependencies, and infra for vulnerabilities and policy violations; create security issues and remediation suggestions.
- Scope: Static scans, dependency checks, runtime anomaly detection; may block PRs via policy gates (configurable).
- Inputs:
  - repo_snapshot
  - dependency_list
  - runtime_signals
- Outputs:
  - threat_alerts
  - remediation_steps
  - risk_score
- Side effects: create security issues/tickets; may add policy gates
- Permissions required: read code and runtime telemetry; write security issues
- Model / algorithm: Rule-based scanners + ML anomaly detectors for runtime
- Rate limits / QPS: Scheduled daily + on-demand per push
- Expected latency: minutes for full scans
- Failure modes & escalation path: False positives => triage by security reviewer
- Safety rules & guardrails: Redact vulnerability details in public logs; avoid leaking secrets in alerts
- Telemetry & logs: agent.scan_run, agent.vuln_found
- Tests: Seeded vulnerable tests; dependency snapshot comparisons
- Deployment & rollout plan: Runs in hardened pipeline with encryption and audit logging
- Cost estimate & budget: Low to moderate; scheduled scanning windows
- Owner / contact: security lead
