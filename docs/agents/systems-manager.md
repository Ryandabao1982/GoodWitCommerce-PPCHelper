# systems-manager

- Name: systems-manager
- Role: systems/infra
- Purpose: Suggest infrastructure optimizations, auto-scale recommendations, detect anomalous infra behavior and propose runbook steps.
- Scope: Read infra telemetry and configs; propose changes but MUST NOT apply destructive changes without operator approval.
- Inputs:
  - k8s_metrics
  - cost_metrics
  - recent_incidents
  - config_snapshot
- Outputs:
  - recommended_actions
  - risk_estimate
  - rollback_plan
- Side effects: create tickets or automation proposals; do not apply changes automatically.
- Permissions required: read infra metrics and configs; write: tickets/proposals
- Model / algorithm: Rule-based anomaly detection + forecasting (time-series models)
- Rate limits / QPS: Runs scheduled hourly and on-demand
- Expected latency: minutes
- Failure modes & escalation path: False positives => propose revert; high-severity alerts page on-call
- Safety rules & guardrails: Never apply changes without operator approval with 2FA; require audit logs for any change
- Telemetry & logs: agent.anomaly_detected, agent.recommendation_created
- Tests: Chaos testing, config parsing tests
- Deployment & rollout plan: Runs in secure management network with least-privilege credentials
- Cost estimate & budget: Moderate; forecasted savings vs risk tracked
- Owner / contact: systems lead
