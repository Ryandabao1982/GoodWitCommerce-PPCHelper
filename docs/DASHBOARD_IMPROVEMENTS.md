### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
// New state variables
const [lastActiveBrand, setLastActiveBrand] = useState<string | null>(() => 
  loadFromLocalStorage<string | null>('ppcGeniusLastActiveBrand', null)
);
const [filterType, setFilterType] = useState<FilterType>('all');
const [filterCompetition, setFilterCompetition] = useState<FilterCompetition>('all');
const [searchFilter, setSearchFilter] = useState('');
```

#### Props Enhancement
```typescript
interface DashboardProps {
  data: KeywordData[];
  parseVolume: (volume: string) => number;
  brands?: string[];
  activeBrand?: string | null;
  brandStates?: Record<string, BrandState>;
  onSelectBrand?: (brand: string) => void;
  onCreateBrand?: () => void;
  recentSearches?: string[];
  lastActiveBrand?: string | null;
}
```

#### Filtering Logic
```typescript
const sortedData = useMemo(() => {
  let filtered = [...data];
  
  // Apply filters
  if (filterType !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(item => item.type === filterType);
  }
  
  if (filterCompetition !== 'all') {
    filtered = filtered.filter(item => item.competition === filterCompetition);
  }
  
  if (searchFilter.trim()) {
    const search = searchFilter.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(item => 
      item.keyword.toLowerCase().includes(search) ||
      item.category.toLowerCase().includes(search)
    );
  }
  
  // Apply sorting...
  return filtered;
}, [data, sortField, sortDirection, filterType, filterCompetition, searchFilter]);
```
