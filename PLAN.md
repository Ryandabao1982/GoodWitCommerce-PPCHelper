| `[TASK-06]` | Results Table with Sorting & Visuals | Done | `PRO.md#2.3`, `PRO.md#3.3` |

---

## Sprint 2: AI-Powered Insights (Complete)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-07]` | Implement "Related Ideas" Feature | Done | `PRO.md#2.4` |
| `[TASK-08]` | Implement "Keyword Clustering" | Done | `PRO.md#2.4` |
| `[TASK-13]` | Implement "Keyword Deep Dive" Analysis | Done | `PRO.md#2.4` |

---

## Sprint 3: Campaign & Workflow Tools (Complete)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-09]` | Implement Campaign & Ad Group Hierarchy Management | Done | `PRO.md#2.6` |
| `[TASK-11]` | Bulk Keyword Actions (Assign to Campaign/Ad Group, Delete) | Done | `PRO.md#2.7` |
| `[TASK-15]` | Consolidate Campaign/Planner Views into Unified Workspace | Done | `PRO.md#2.5` |
| `[TASK-16]` | Enhance Campaign Templates with Detailed Taxonomy | Done | `PRO.md#2.6` |

---

## Sprint 4: Visualization & Usability (In Progress)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement & Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-20]` | Export Campaign Plan | Done | **Requirement**: `PRO.md#2.7`<br>**Details**: Add a feature to the Campaign Manager that exports the complete campaign structure to a CSV file. The format should be compatible with Amazon's bulk upload templates, with columns for `Campaign Name`, `Ad Group Name`, `Keyword Text`, `Match Type`, `Status` (defaulted to 'Enabled'), and an empty `Bid` column for the user to fill in. |
| `[TASK-10]` | Data Visualization for Keyword Clusters | To Do | **Requirement**: `PRO.md#2.4`, `PRO.md#3.0`<br>**Details**: Implement an interactive visualization for the keyword clusters. This could be a bubble chart where each bubble represents a cluster, sized by the number of keywords it contains, or a tree map for a more compact view. Clicking on a cluster visualization should filter the main Keyword Bank table to show only the keywords from that cluster. |
| `[TASK-12]` | User Onboarding & Guided Tour | To Do | **Requirement**: `PRO.md#3.0`<br>**Details**: Implement a multi-step guided tour for first-time users (e.g., using Shepherd.js). The tour will walk through the core workflow: 1. Creating a Brand. 2. Performing the first keyword search. 3. Understanding the Keyword Bank and its data. 4. Navigating to the Campaign Planner. 5. Creating a campaign using a template. |
| `[TASK-14]` | Drag-and-Drop Keyword Assignment | To Do | **Requirement**: `PRO.md#2.6`<br>**Details**: Enhance the **Campaign Planner** view by allowing users to drag selected keywords from the Keyword Bank table (on the right) and drop them directly onto an ad group in the Campaign Manager list (on the left). This will provide a faster, more intuitive alternative to the current bulk-assign modal workflow. |

## Sprint 5: Advanced Features & Integrations (To Do)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement & Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-17]` | Negative Keyword Management | To Do | **Requirement**: Future Enhancement<br>**Details**: Add a new primary view for managing Negative Keyword Lists. Users will be able to create and manage lists (e.g., "Brand Negatives," "Generic Negatives"). These lists can then be applied at the campaign level within the Campaign Planner. The UI will support adding, editing, and deleting negative keywords in bulk. |
| `[TASK-18]` | Performance Metrics Integration | To Do | **Requirement**: Future Enhancement<br>**Details**: Introduce an optional integration with the Amazon Advertising API via a secure OAuth flow. Once connected, the application will fetch key performance metrics (Impressions, Clicks, CPC, Spend, Sales, ACoS) for keywords and campaigns. This data will be displayed directly in the Keyword Bank table, allowing users to compare research data with actual performance. |
| `[TASK-19]` | AI-Powered Bid Suggestions | To Do | **Requirement**: Future Enhancement<br>**Details**: Expand the "Keyword Deep Dive" feature. When performance data is integrated (from `[TASK-18]`), the AI prompt will be enhanced to include the keyword's actual performance metrics and a user-defined target ACoS. The model will then provide a more data-driven bid suggestion (e.g., "Target ACoS is 30%, current CPC is high. Suggest lowering bid to $X.XX to improve profitability."). |

## Sprint 7: Backend Infrastructure & Database (Planning Phase)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement & Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-25]` | Backend Architecture Planning & Documentation | Done | **Requirement**: Infrastructure Enhancement<br>**Details**: Create comprehensive backend implementation plan (BACKEND_PLAN.md) documenting database schema, API endpoints, technology stack recommendations, migration strategy from localStorage to backend, security considerations, deployment architecture, and implementation timeline. This establishes the foundation for transitioning from browser-based localStorage to a scalable cloud backend. |
| `[TASK-26]` | Backend MVP Implementation | To Do | **Requirement**: Infrastructure Enhancement<br>**Dependencies**: `[TASK-25]`<br>**Details**: Implement Phase 1 of backend plan - Set up Supabase project, create database schema with PostgreSQL, implement row-level security policies, set up authentication (email/password), create basic API structure for brands and keywords, implement user registration/login, and deploy to staging environment. |
| `[TASK-27]` | Core API Development | To Do | **Requirement**: Infrastructure Enhancement<br>**Dependencies**: `[TASK-26]`<br>**Details**: Implement Phase 2 of backend plan - Build complete CRUD APIs for brands, keywords, campaigns, ad groups, search history, and keyword clusters. Implement proper error handling, validation, pagination, and write comprehensive API integration tests. |
| `[TASK-28]` | Frontend Integration with Backend | To Do | **Requirement**: Infrastructure Enhancement<br>**Dependencies**: `[TASK-27]`<br>**Details**: Implement Phase 3 of backend plan - Create API client service layer in frontend, replace localStorage calls with API calls, implement authentication UI flow, add loading states and error handling, implement data migration tool UI, add offline detection with request queuing, and conduct beta testing with select users. |
| `[TASK-29]` | Data Migration & Production Launch | To Do | **Requirement**: Infrastructure Enhancement<br>**Dependencies**: `[TASK-28]`<br>**Details**: Implement Phase 4 of backend plan - Run parallel localStorage + backend mode for validation, monitor and fix production issues, implement caching strategy for performance, conduct security audit, perform complete data migration for all users, and execute public launch. |

## Sprint 6: Documentation & Quality (Complete)

| ID | Title | Status | Requirement & Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[TASK-21]` | Create METRICS.md | Done | **Requirement**: PROTOCOL.md#7<br>**Details**: Implement the project metrics dashboard as required by the AI Vibe Coder Protocol v3.0. Track development velocity, code quality, documentation health, sprint progress, and technical debt. Establish baseline metrics for future tracking. |
| `[TASK-22]` | Comprehensive README.md | Done | **Requirement**: PROTOCOL.md#6<br>**Details**: Create complete project documentation in README.md including installation guide, feature overview, technical architecture, development workflow, roadmap, and contribution guidelines. Replace placeholder text with comprehensive user-facing documentation. |
| `[TASK-23]` | Update BUILD_LOG.md | Done | **Requirement**: PROTOCOL.md#6<br>**Details**: Add entry to BUILD_LOG.md documenting the comprehensive documentation review and updates. Maintain chronological record of all project changes as required by the protocol. |
| `[TASK-24]` | Update CHANGELOG.md | Done | **Requirement**: PROTOCOL.md#6<br>**Details**: Document documentation updates in CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased] section. Maintain user-facing changelog with all notable changes. |
